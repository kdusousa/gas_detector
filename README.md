# GAS DETECTOR

The detection of flammable gases in real-time reduces the possibility of damage caused by human exposure to them.


Detector of flammable gases in the presence of ammonia, aromatic compounds, sulfur, sulfide, benzene vapors, carbon dioxide (CO2), smoke, alcohol, etc., with Bluetooth communication.

# Sensors and Peripherals Used:

## Sensors:

MQ-135 Air Quality Hazardous Gas Sensor Module

## Peripherals:

Protoboard
Jumper wires
Bluetooth Serial SPP Module (Master/Slave)

# Development:

Figure 1 shows the schematic of the developed project. Figure 2 displays the assembled prototype, and Figure 3 shows the prototype in operation.

ADC was used for signal conversion, and UART for communication via Bluetooth.

The project code, as well as a video demonstration, is attached.
